      <h2>What is Disease Sim?</h2>
      Disease Sim is a tool to help you simulate disease spread. By setting the
      parameters, you can watch how the epidemic will unfold.

      <h2>The States</h2>
      The states used in the simulation are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Healthy - someone who has never had the disease and is susceptible.
        </li>

        <li>
          Asymptomatic - someone who is infected, but doesn't show symptoms, and
          will social distance less than someone who does show symptoms.
        </li>

        <li>Infected - someone who is infected and shows symptoms.</li>

        <li>
          Severely Infected - someone who is infected and who's condition is
          very bad. Severely infected people will go to the hospital if there is
          room.
        </li>

        <li>
          Recovered - someone who had the disease, but no longer does. Recovered
          people cannot become infected again.
        </li>

        <li>Dead - someone who has died from the disease.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Parameters</h2>
      The parameters are:
      <ul>
        <li>Population size - the total number of people in the simulation.</li>

        <li>
          Initial infected population - how many people will start out with the
          disease.
        </li>

        <li>
          Infection radius - the minimum distance two people can be from each
          other before the disease can spread between them.<br />
          This parameter is relative to the size of a person. E.g. a value of 3
          means the distance two people can be apart before the disease can
          spread between them is equivalent to the size of 3 people.
        </li>

        <li>
          Infection rate - the probability that the disease can spread between
          two people every day.
        </li>

        <li>
          Recovery rate - the probability that an infected person will recover
          every day.
        </li>

        <li>
          Mortality rate - the probability that an infected person will die
          every day.
        </li>

        <li>
          Hospital capacity - the maximum number of people that can be in the
          hospital.
        </li>

        <li>
          Hospital recovery rate - the probability that someone in the hospital
          will recover every day.
        </li>

        <li>
          Hospital mortality rate - the probability that someone in the hospital
          will die every day.
        </li>

        <li>
          Social distance radius - the minimum distance two people can be from
          each other before they will begin to socially distance from each
          other.<br />
          This parameter is relative to the size of a person. E.g. a value of 3
          means the distance two people can be apart before they socially
          distance from each other is equivalent to the size of 3 people.
        </li>

        <li>
          Asymptomatic period - the number of days a person is asymptomatic for.
        </li>

        <li>
          Infectious period - the maximum number of days a person can be
          infected for
        </li>
      </ul>
